About Picarro:
Picarro is pioneering a unique confluence of hardware, software and cloud-based computing unlike anything being done today. By manufacturing the precision instruments at the core of this technology as well as developing the algorithms that enable cogent information to be derived from the data, we are transforming how world-class scientific, industrial and regulatory compliance measurements are made, and more importantly, who makes them.
Infrared optical spectroscopy is a proven technology for delivering precise, real-time measurement of the constituents in a gas stream with high sensitivity and selectivity. Recent developments in laser technology allow for a very significant increase in the number of species that can be measured simultaneously, leading to an unprecedented increase in the amount of information that can be collected and to corresponding challenges in extracting information from the results.

Company Description

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.

As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.

The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.

The California ISO is committed to the health, safety, and work/life integration of it employees and is proud to offer flexible work arrangements. This position would be eligible to participate in a hybrid schedule.

Relocation Assistance is available.

Not at all costs, but we give it our all because our customers are hustling to grow their businesses, and the hustle’s more fun when we’re winning together.

""Unrelenting Feedback"": We collaborate for more than the high-fives (although they’re pretty great), and our team thrives on timely and direct feedback. There’s no hesitation in being direct; since we’re surrounded by smart people, we embrace thoughtful and challenging perspectives.",18000
