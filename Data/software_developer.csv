Our dream of revolutionizing the fitness and wellness industry is no small feat, and we're looking for talented people to make it a reality. When you join Mindbody + ClassPass, you’ll work with kind, intelligent people and enjoy unrivaled benefits. You’ll also share in a true culture of purpose and passion centered around helping people live happier, healthier lives. We’re not just another thriving company—we’re far and away the leader of our industry. So join the team, and let’s see what we can accomplish together!

Who we are

At Mindbody + ClassPass, we’re innovating for the future of wellness by bringing together the best of both sides of the market: Mindbody is the industry’s most trusted technology platform, empowering tens of thousands of wellness brands around the world with the software and resources they need to run and grow their businesses.

We’re on a mission to create a wellness community for all—opening the doors to more authentic, local wellness experiences than ever before.

About The Right Team Member

You love to design robust and easy to use APIs and services. You know the best software is created through collaboration and iteration and you’re looking for the right opportunity, and the right team, to expand your experience. You seek feedback because it has the ability to turn good work into great work. You like to ship software early and often, you value simplicity and strive to eliminate unnecessary complexity.

At ClassPass we value people who are intellectually curious, who are pragmatic not dogmatic, and people who care about our product, their teammates, and their own personal growth. We are faced with an interesting set of technical challenges, and we believe in giving our engineers the autonomy to go and solve them. Much of our team come from non-traditional computing backgrounds; we know that by bringing together a diverse set of voices we’ll be able to build a better product, and a better company. We care less about what languages or frameworks you know, and care more that you are excited to produce high-quality code and be constantly learning. Our engineers work in cross-functional teams that are focused on impact, and movement between teams is encouraged. We work very closely with our brilliant product team to deliver a world class user experience, and ultimately to empower our users to live their fullest, healthiest lives.

About The Role

Apply MLOps concepts and your best engineering principles and skills to improve performance, maintainability and reliability of our production level ML Systems.
Contribute to complex data flows while working with ML engineers to support building ML models at scale.
Achieve a deep understanding of the data by performing exploratory data analysis to determine what data is available and how to develop it into model features.
Learn what is critical for running a successful business by working with product managers to understand and clarify a business goal so we can measure it. Determine actions which would support the business goal.
Review existing systems, understand their current technical characteristics, and modify them as necessary to support their operations as the data scientists run experiments and iterate on them.
Exercise your abstract thinking skills as you automate testing and monitoring of the systems, because there are no easy yes/no answers with data systems.

Skills & Experience

Knowledge of Python and Java/Kotlin.
Working knowledge of machine learning concepts and tools.
Good SQL and data exploration skills.
Familiarity with AWS systems from S3 and SQS to Athena and SageMaker.
Familiarity with production monitoring platforms like DataDog and NewRelic.
Understand software engineering and data processing best practices.
Desire to help people stay motivated and keep fit.

Pay Transparency

It is Mindbody’s intent to pay all Team Members competitive wages and salaries that are motivational, fair and equitable. The goal of Mindbody’s compensation program is to be transparent, attract potential employees, meet the needs of all current employees, and encourage Team Members to stay with our organization.

Actual compensation packages are based on several factors that are unique to each candidate, including but not limited to skill set, depth of experience, certifications, and specific work location.

The base salary range for this position in the United States is $140,300 to $210,500. The total compensation package for this position may also include performance bonus, benefits and/or other applicable incentive compensation plans.

Have we piqued your curiosity?

Sound like the role for you? We’d love to hear from you! Even if you’re not 100% sure about potential fit, we still encourage you to apply. We’re looking for the right person, not the perfect series of checkboxes.

Mindbody is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We highly value diversity at our company and encourage people of all different backgrounds, experiences, abilities and perspectives to apply. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or other protected characteristics.",4000

We are always looking to connect with Sr. Full Stack Engineers who are passionate about building the tools to help our users improve their lives. We value people who are not afraid to dig into other people’s code, think that code is the best documentation, and like to experiment with new technologies but understand the risk of pushing them to production. We like to work with engineers who believe learning a concept is more important than learning a framework. They pick technologies outside their comfort zone when they believe they’re the best tool for solving a particular problem.

Noom’s engineering team is a mission-driven team, powered by science, technology, and world-class talent. As a senior team member, you will be at the forefront of our top challenges, solving complex technical problems centered around habits, behavior, and lifestyle.

What We Look For

5+ years of experience designing and managing complex web-based applications, with a focus on picking the right tool for the job. We are built on AWS technologies and our teams use Django, Java/Kotlin, Spring, React, with MySQL and PostgreSQL as the backing data store, but we’re always looking for technologies that can make our job easier.
An appreciation for the importance of striking a balance between getting code out quickly and following best practices. We move fast, but we like to build good software and manage risk carefully.
Excellent communicator: you’re comfortable explaining technical problems in person and writing.
Team player: you enjoy teaching new concepts to, and collaborating with, the team.
Strong sense of responsibility and ownership; you will come from an environment where people are responsible for their own code.

What Makes This Job Amazing

You’ll be helping millions of people lead healthier lives every day
You’ll experience huge learning & professional growth opportunities. Noom believes in supporting you; we’ll cover the cost of books, courses, conferences… you name it!
You’ll become part of our transparent, high-performing, and close-knit team.
We guarantee you will learn a tremendous amount in a short time. There is a significant opportunity for advancement for those who value and excel in transparent, high-intensity, and high-impact environments.

Base Salary:

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $171,000 - $231,000.
Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. The range displayed on each job posting is based on Noom’s estimate as of the date of publication and reflects the minimum and maximum target for the position across all US locations. The actual placement of the candidate within the range is based on factors including but not limited to relevant experience, assessment of functional skills and behavioral competencies, scope, and location. This range is not inclusive of any discretionary bonus or equity package.

Build something new with a world-class team.

At Genesys, we allow our employees to make their mark by entrusting them to make decisions and do what they’ve been hired to do: their very best. Your potential is waiting; why are you?

Summary

Are you someone who likes solving complex problems using cutting edge technology? Are you interested in contributing to the design, stability, and reliability of the microservices and micro-frontends deployed in AWS Cloud? Do you want to work in an environment where you have the flexibility to grow your skillset? If so, this job might be for you.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will contribute to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and monitoring of your team’s features and services to enhance the Genesys Cloud Workforce Engagement Management (WEM) product suite.

What This Role Isn’t

This role is not building simple single page sites, or single tenant services. We are developing for a complex multi-tenant cloud ecosystem. You will be contributing to complex features from design to the actual deployment and monitoring of your work in Genesys Cloud.

What You’ll Bring To The Table

To be successful, you should be a strong problem solver that wants to contribute to our team and product suite. You should be curious about cloud technology and expand your skillset. You should be able to propose and design practical solutions, not just describe problems. Being resourceful and detail-oriented will contribute to your success here at Genesys.

Design, build, and troubleshoot web applications
Contribute to shared web components to be used within the team and by others
Understand our APIs to use them efficiently in our web applications
Unit, integration, and manual testing of the code changes done by the team
Look for opportunities for improvement: code, architecture, infrastructure, processes
Participate in code reviews to learn and grow as well as to help others to learn through constructive feedback
Mentor other engineers to help them grow technically and get past blockers
Participate in regular meetings for open communication, sharing ideas, and supporting others

Minimum requirements:

3+ years of experience in software development (computer science or equivalent degrees, certifications or other professional experience will be considered).
Solid experience and understanding of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
Experience with one or more JavaScript frameworks (ie. Vue, Knockout, React, Angular, etc.)
Experience with Object Oriented Programming languages and RESTful APIs
Experience with the full application lifecycle from development through deployment and support
Excellent critical thinking and reasoning; must effectively communicate with peers across development groups and business units
Have an understanding or a deep desire to learn about microservices and cloud development
Knowledge of agile methodologies and best practices for continuous delivery (CD)
Open to learning new technologies
Ability to work well alone and as part of a distributed team

Compensation:

This role has a market-competitive salary with an anticipated base compensation range listed below. Actual salaries will vary depending on a candidate’s experience, qualifications, skills, and location. This role might also be eligible for a commission or performance-based bonus opportunities.

$80,600.00 - $167,400.00

Benefits:

Medical, Dental, and Vision Insurance.
Telehealth coverage
Flexible work schedules and work from home opportunities
Development and career growth opportunities
Open Time Off in addition to 10 paid holidays
401(k) matching program
Adoption Assistance
Fertility treatments

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:

You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

The mission of the Developer Product Group engineers is to create solutions so builders can build in crypto. Their suite of products include: Base, WaaS, and Cloud. Our most recent offering, Coinbase Base, is an Ethereum L2 built to scale the crypto economy, the foundation for continuing the on-chain journey. Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) is an API-based crypto platform that will enable developers to interact with heterogeneous cryptocurrency networks (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano) in a simple, secure and scalable way. Coinbase Cloud provides web3 APIs, services, and infrastructure to power the next generation of software builders.

We are specifically looking for a fullstack engineer to join the Base team with emphasis in the frontend, to enable and accelerate the success of Base. You’ll be working as a fullstack engineer across all components of our system. The frontend: bridge, marketing, and docs webapps, built in typescript; the backend: Base testnet and mainnet deployments, using golang; and internal product integrations and infrastructure.

What You'll Be Doing

Building and maintaining our frontend web applications with high quality standards
Open sourcing the web repos and managing the open source contributions and issues from the community
Assisting with Base oncall, debugging the issues that can arise with our L2 blockchain in production and testnet
Building key components of the OP Stack to further the decentralization of Base and other L2s

What We Look For In You

You have at least 5 years of experience in software engineering and at least 4 years of experience in developing web apps and shipping user-facing features with JavaScript and modern, component-based JS frameworks like React.
You've developed and shipped user-facing features using component-based UI frameworks.
You’re familiar with current trends and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, security and usability.
You’re familiar with product and design lifecycles, and collaborating closely with designers, engineers, and product managers.
You write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.

Nice To Haves

You have experience with Blockchains (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.)
You’ve worked with Golang, Geth, Hardhat, Solidity
You have contributed to the SuperChain via either OP Stack contributions or Base contributions
Experience with growth experiments or A/B testing frameworks.
You’ve built responsive web or mobile applications

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto.

We are specifically looking for a fullstack engineer to join the Base team with emphasis in the frontend, to enable and accelerate the success of Base. You’ll be working as a fullstack engineer across all components of our system.

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:

You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

The mission of the Developer Product Group engineers is to create solutions so builders can build in crypto. Their suite of products include: Base, WaaS, and Cloud. Our most recent offering, Coinbase Base, is an Ethereum L2 built to scale the crypto economy, the foundation for continuing the on-chain journey. Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) is an API-based crypto platform that will enable developers to interact with heterogeneous cryptocurrency networks (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano) in a simple, secure and scalable way. Coinbase Cloud provides web3 APIs, services, and infrastructure to power the next generation of software builders.

We are specifically looking for a fullstack engineer to join the Base team with emphasis in the frontend, to enable and accelerate the success of Base. You’ll be working as a fullstack engineer across all components of our system. The frontend: bridge, marketing, and docs webapps, built in typescript; the backend: Base testnet and mainnet deployments, using golang; and internal product integrations and infrastructure.

What You'll Be Doing

Building and maintaining our frontend web applications with high quality standards
Open sourcing the web repos and managing the open source contributions and issues from the community
Assisting with Base oncall, debugging the issues that can arise with our L2 blockchain in production and testnet
Building key components of the OP Stack to further the decentralization of Base and other L2s

What We Look For In You

You have at least 5 years of experience in software engineering and at least 4 years of experience in developing web apps and shipping user-facing features with JavaScript and modern, component-based JS frameworks like React.
You've developed and shipped user-facing features using component-based UI frameworks.
You’re familiar with current trends and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, security and usability.
You’re familiar with product and design lifecycles, and collaborating closely with designers, engineers, and product managers.
You write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.

Nice To Haves

You have experience with Blockchains (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.)
You’ve worked with Golang, Geth, Hardhat, Solidity
You have contributed to the SuperChain via either OP Stack contributions or Base contributions
Experience with growth experiments or A/B testing frameworks.
You’ve built responsive web or mobile applications

Kiavi, formerly known as LendingHome, is one of the largest lenders to real estate investors in the United States. With Kiavi’s technology platform and innovative financing solutions, real estate investors are empowered to make informed decisions, close deals faster, and realize the full potential of their real estate investment strategies.

Founded in 2013, Kiavi is committed to helping customers revitalize approximately $25 trillion worth of aged U.S. housing stock and provide move-in ready homes and rental housing for millions of Americans across the country. We have funded almost $13 billion dollars worth of loans across about 52,000+ projects, becoming one of the nation's largest bridge loan lenders.

Combining our technology and industry expertise, Kiavi has grown to a team of over 400 and has won many awards over the years including Forbes Fintech 50, Finovate Awards: Best Digital Mortgage Platform, Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, and many more.











We are looking for frontend, backend and full stack engineers. It all depends on where you can have the most impact. We have both functional and cross-functional teams. The product-oriented teams are cross-functional and are able to work quickly without taking dependencies in order to deliver the most impact in the shortest amount of time. These cross-functional teams operate like small independent business units with their own goals that align with the company goals.









Growth

The Growth team is the most exciting team at Kiavi. Shh. Don’t tell the others. Growth works to improve loan volume and margin through feature work that meets our customers where they are. We work on a number of new initiatives to broaden and improve our existing financial products. This includes projects like taking Kiavi to new states, and broadening the capabilities of our short term loans to handle condominiums and new construction. Within this work is a license to improve and future proof existing architecture via modular and robust service oriented architecture.

Our team seeks out the most arduous or inefficient processes in our loan origination system and fixes them. We get to the root of flaws in the design of our legacy software and products and fix both, aggressively extracting specific business concerns into dedicated services and improving the experience for our internal and external users. The kinds of improvements we’re seeking include avoiding wasted work by our loan origination experts so they can get more done, getting specific approvals and denials to our customers early in their application process, and transforming our code base from a monolithic application to a set of services and web applications with clear responsibilities.

Role Responsibilities

Catylist is a fully remote team at Moody’s Analytics focused on organizing the world’s commercial real estate data. We use this information to help all kinds of people make better decisions, whether that means finding the perfect office space or understanding the potential impacts of climate change on their manufacturing facility or shopping center. We’re always looking for interesting ways to connect data and solve real-life problems.

Our team includes about a dozen full-stack developers.
We care about culture, and many of us have worked together for over a decade.
We use JavaScript (ReactJS) on the front-end and Java on the back-end.
We use a microservices architecture and practice continuous integration.
We host everything from AWS and believe in infrastructure-as-code.
We're not dogmatic about our tools/technologies – we use whatever best suits the task at hand.
We communicate mainly via GitLab, Slack, and Zoom, but try to get everybody together in person a couple times a year (retreats & conferences).

We have big goals planned for the coming years and could really use your help.

Role / Responsibilities

We’re looking for a talented developer who’s at home in the codebase. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the flexibility to contribute on both the front-end and back-end all across the stack:

Designing and implementing frameworks and re-usable software components.
Owning projects from start to finish, collaborating with others on the team and pushing code daily.
Developing standards and conventions, mentoring other developers and reviewing code.
Finding and fixing inefficiencies in code or process and working to make the team better every day.

Qualifications

This isn’t your first rodeo – you have significant (7+ years) production experience building scalable web applications and APIs hosted in a Cloud environment.
You have a complicated relationship with JavaScript, loving the good parts and understanding the bad. You might not label yourself as an expert, but others would.
You have solid experience with ReactJS, including functional components and hooks.
You have solid experience writing enterprise-level application back-ends or APIs in an object-oriented language like Java.
You have a practical understanding of both the benefits and pitfalls of a microservices architecture.
You’re a quick study, stay up with the latest-and-greatest ideas, and enjoy learning new things.
You believe in the mantra: ""strong opinions, weakly held"".
You’re an excellent communicator (with and without emoji).
You value stability, work/life balance, group decision-making, and working with people that are good-natured, open-minded, interesting, hard-working, and self-motivated.
You’re looking for a family to join for the long term, not a stepping stone toward another gig.

Moody’s Analytics products are becoming an essential tool in the rapidly expanding Commercial Real Estate market. We deliver an integrated and holistic platform that automates critical processes and generates insights and recommendations to drive better decisions. Lenders, asset managers and brokers are some of our biggest customers.

About Mixpanel

Mixpanel is a leading product analytics software company, currently helping the world answer 81 million product questions every year. Our pioneering event-based tracking solution gives product teams the ability to gain insights into how to best acquire, convert, and retain their users across web and mobile platforms.

Powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use, Mixpanel enables teams to learn from their user data and innovate rapidly in creating winning products. Today, we serve nearly 7,000 paying customers through seven offices globally in our quest to provide the most in-depth product analytics that everyone can use and trust.





Mixpanel engineering is a small team that works quickly, prioritizing getting value to customers and iterating to make those experiences better. We offer the most powerful product analytics tool while still focusing on making the user experience delightful. The full stack engineers have the freedom to move about the stack to deliver value to customers without being blocked by ownership silos. This means doing everything from building snappy UIs and fast and reliable services to leveraging our powerful query engine to get the customers answers that help deliver great products. We are looking for folks who seek to understand and own customer problems, participating in every step of the development life cycle from ideation to delivery and maintenance. We encourage ownership and autonomy—if you see customer pain points, you will be empowered to fix them. There is no ""not my problem"" at Mixpanel. All customer problems are ours to fix. We believe that our UX is a key differentiator, and we invest heavily in UI, aiming for a snappy and intuitive experience. We believe in Product-Led Growth, that even enterprise adoption of software tools starts with individual users and the way to get there is through creating a user experience that gets customers to answers quickly.



At Mixpanel Engineering, Product, and Design (EPD) work closely in pods to define the product and experiences. You'll be collaborating closely with your EPD team to create a vision for delightful and intuitive UX, then work to deliver the most impactful features for our customers. You'll be owning key pieces of the product, maintaining them, and always advocating for improvements to make the user experience even better, adding to our growing shared components library and expanding our design system. You’ll be working on our web app, which is built in Python, running Django, with an open source JavaScript framework running the front end. Everything is run on Google Cloud Platform, using Kubernetes and Docker for orchestration and containerization of our services.

A typical project requires working across our stack, creating endpoints for your feature as well as developing and deploying the UI. Here are some projects we've worked on in the past to give you an idea of what to expect.

A way for customers to share their metrics publicly, a pain point for customers who want to easily share their data on social media or with executive leadership. This feature required keeping an eye on security so unintentional data would not be leaked for customers, but would enable easier collaboration.

We rebuilt our Live View from the ground up and rebranded to Events. Our goal was to improve users’ trust and make debugging their data and query results easier. With these goals in mind, we removed a number of limitations from Live View, improved key work flows, and tightened the UX. We also drastically simplified both the back-end and front-end architecture resulting in a more performant and maintainable product. The end result is a more powerful tool for our users and a simpler codebase for our developers.

We revamped our dashboards UI to improve the workflow for creating and saving analyses that also had the nice side effect of making our data model clearer. This required us to iterate and polish while learning more about how customers used and worked around our product in their day to day. We applied these learnings to smooth our workflows even more while continuing to set the stage for more series of improvements.

We redesigned our query builder to allow users to instantly see the results of their changes on one screen. This was required balancing competing requirements of visual space for the query builder and the ability to see two things at once, resulting in a more intuitive UX.

We made segmentation faster allowing users to customize what they can compare at the query time vs deciding everything they will ever need at the time they develop your product.
